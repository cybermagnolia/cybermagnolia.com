[junior.guru](https://junior.guru/) is an inspiring tech community for Czech coding newbies and juniors created by Honza Javorek. You get a support group, advice, mentors, career counseling, and more. There's a public handbook with tons of useful information about how to start with coding and how to get your first job in tech, and there's also a job board specifically focused on entry level and junior positions.

The community thrives thanks to the work of its creator. Honza has been a volunteer in the local Python programming language user group since 2011 and earned our admiration as a PyLadies coach, and a co-organizer of [PyConCZ](https://cz.pycon.org/) conferences.

To create junior.guru Honza left behind his work of a Consulting Member of Technical Staff and Open Source Maintainer at Apiary (by then acquired by Oracle). He decided to pursue his passion for helping coding newbies and juniors in tech.

We kicked off the partnership with a talk for the [junior.guru club](https://junior.guru/club/) about tips & tricks to be more productive at work as a junior.
